# qlora-wizard-coder-finetune-notebook
A QLoRa fine-tuning Jupyter notebook for Hugging Face's Transformers library. Use https://runpod.io, and launch a PyTorch 2 pod with Jupyter access, with at least 40GB of VRAM. Then just clone this repo in the RunPod's `/workspace` folder.

Note: Make sure you set the RunPod's storage settings to more than the 40GB provided. You will probably need 60GB of persistent storage and 40GB of temporary storage.
